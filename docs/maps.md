> [!TIP] Trail apps like YAMAP and AllTrails are must-haves! 🥾

You may think you do not need a map for a well-marked trail, but you really do need one for the following reasons:
* Restroom locations 💩
* Time estimates ⏱️
* Trail conditions (muddy, fallen trees, etc.) 🌲
* Photo and lunch spots 📸 🍱
* Transport information (bus stops, train stations, etc.) 🚉 🚌 🚠

> [!IMPORTANT] TRUST ME! YOU NEED IT!  
> Or you will really wish you had one when you are crawling back to the train station far past your schedule after hiking in the dark.


## AllTrails

[AllTrails][] is a popular hiking app in the United States and has some coverage of Japanese trails.
* If you cannot read any Japanese, this is your best option.
* Great app and hiking community.
* AllTrails lacks details (restrooms, lunch spots, etc.) for Japanese mountains.
