# {{$frontmatter.title}}

I HIGHLY recommend using an app like YAMAP or AllTrails when hiking!

You may think you do not need a map for a well-marked trail, but you really do need one for the following reasons:
* Restroom locations 💩
* Time estimates ⏱️
* Trail conditions (muddy, fallen trees, etc.) 🌲
* Photo and lunch spots 📸 🍱
* Transport information (bus stops, train stations, etc.) 🚉 🚌 🚠

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> TRUST ME! YOU NEED IT!  
> Or you will really wished you had when you are crawling back to the train station way past your schedule after hiking in the dark...


## AllTrails

[AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/) is a popular hiking app in the US and has some coverage of Japanese trails.
* If you cannot read any Japanese, this is your best bet.
* Great App & hiking community
* AllTrails lacks details (restrooms, lunch spots, etc.) for Japanese mountains.


## YAMAP

[YAMAP](https://yamap.com/) is one of the most popular Japanese hiking apps and the only one that has any English support.
* Core features are free and have English support.
* Premium features (like multiple offline maps) require a paid subscription.
* Apps and community content are nearly all in Japanese 🥲
* Amazing content as many hikers include trail conditions, transport information, and pictures in their hiking posts.
* YAMAP maps contain vital info like restrooms, benches, and bus stops.

Why use YAMAP?

## YamaReco

[ヤマレコ](https://www.yamareco.com/) is another popular Japanese hiking site.
* The most powerful trail search functionality for Japanese trails and mountains.
* The site is entirely in Japanese.
